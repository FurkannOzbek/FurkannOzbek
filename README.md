## Hello People! :wave:
My name is Furkan Ã–zbek, and Iâ€™m a junior frontend developer. I am originally from Turkey but have been living in Denmark for the past three years. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering, I had to move between countries, which delayed my career in my desired field. Now that Iâ€™m settled, Iâ€™m eager to start my career in frontend development.

## Hello People! :wave:

My name is Furkan Ã–zbek, and Iâ€™m a junior frontend developer. I am originally from Turkey but have been living in Denmark for the past three years. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering, I had to move between countries, which delayed my career in my desired field. Now that Iâ€™m settled, I am about to complete an 8-month web development bootcamp at $${\color{green}HackYourFuture}$$, which is an addition to my education, and Iâ€™m eager to start my career in frontend development.
